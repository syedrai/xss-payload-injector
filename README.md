# xss-payload-injector
Simple Python XSS payload injector for DVWA and basic web pentesting.
# XSS Payload Injector

## üöÄ Description

This is a simple **Python automation script** to demonstrate how to inject **Reflected XSS payloads** into a vulnerable web application such as **DVWA** (Damn Vulnerable Web App).  
It sends test payloads, captures responses, and saves them as HTML files for analysis.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How it works

1. **Target:** The script targets the `xss_r` (Reflected XSS) page in DVWA by default.  
2. **Cookies:** You must provide a valid `PHPSESSID` and security level.  
3. **Payloads:** A list of common XSS payloads is injected into the `name` parameter.  
4. **Responses:** The script saves the HTML response for each payload so you can verify whether the payload executes in the browser.

## ‚úÖ Requirements

- Python 3  
- `requests` library

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install requests

Usage
Edit config in payload_injector.py:

TARGET_URL ‚Äî your DVWA or test lab URL.

COOKIES ‚Äî set your PHPSESSID and security level.

HEADERS ‚Äî adjust if needed.

Run the script:python payload_injector.py


Open the output .html files:

Check the files in your browser to see if the payload executed.
